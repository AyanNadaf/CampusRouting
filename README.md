# CampusRouting
The CampusRouting project likely aims to facilitate navigation within a campus environment. 

1. **Objective:** The project aims to help users navigate within a campus area, guiding them from one location to another using digital maps.

2. **Features:**
   - **Map Visualization:** It provides a digital map of the campus, which users can interact with.
   - **Pathfinding:** Users can input their current location and desired destination, and the system calculates the optimal route between the two points.

3. **Technologies:**
   - **Python:** The project is implemented using the Python programming language, leveraging its libraries for tasks such as data processing, map visualization, and routing                    algorithms.
   - **GeoJSON:** Geographic data in the GeoJSON format is likely used to represent campus maps and building outlines.
   - **Folium:** The Folium library, which allows for the creation of interactive maps using Leaflet.js, is probably utilized for visualizing campus maps within the project.


The CampusRouting project in Python serves to simplify navigation within a campus environment, providing users their way around campus buildings.
